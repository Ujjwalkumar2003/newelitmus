 <h1>Detailed view of the game</h4>
The project has been developed as a way to test soft skills, thus it is only one time play for every user.

<h1>Completion of the game</h1>
The game is meant to test the soft skills, thus keeping user stuck on level forever with no form of rescue is futile.

To avoid this Special actions: skip and End Game, are available at each stage so user can skip the stage by discarding the points or end the game if required.

General Instructions for the game are as follows:
The purpose of this game set is to evaluate your soft skills

We recommend completing all games in one sitting, as the game is designed to be played only once

Points are awarded for correct answers and time taken to solve each game

The timer will not be visible on screen

In the event of an emergency such as a power outage, technical difficulties, or network issues, you may resume the game from where you left off

Timer will continue on the server but your progress won't be lost

Please be attentive to all information presented in the game

If you find yourself at a dead end, you can choose to review the previous stage, which may provide clues to help you progress past the current stage

If necessary, you have the option to skip a stage, though this will result in forfeiting any potential points for that stage

You may end the game at any time, regardless of what stage you are on and receive results till there
